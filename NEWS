  with other modules.
  (Kalev Lember) Bug #645669

atkmm 2.22.4 (stable):

* Avoid a tarball dependency on mm-common.
  (Murray Cumming)

atkmm 2.22.3 (stable):

Just a tarball regeneration due to a changed m4 macro in mm-common.

atkmm 2.22.2 (stable):

* Install m4 files needed by recent versions of gtkmm when building from git.

atkmm 2.22.1 (stable):

* Distribute the GPL in the tarball, in addition to the LGPL, because the

  (Murray Cumming)

atkmm 2.21.1 (unstable)

First release as a separate module. This was previously part of the gtkmm module.
Distro packagers should deal with this in the same way that they dealt with
pangomm when that was split off from gtkmm.
